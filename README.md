# Parallel-MINOBS
Parallel-MINOBS is an structure learning algorithm of Bayesian networks that operates on Candidate Parent Sets (CPSs). Parallel-MINOBS applies to combinatorial optimization of CPSs that are up to tens of millions or even more. Specifically, sets of promising CPSs are sampled by running "main.m" file. Then, sampled CPSs are parallelly optimized by running "main.cpp" on Linux.
